# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Even-Odd League: Multi-Agent Competition System

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2026
**Status:** Approved

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision

The Even-Odd League is a distributed multi-agent system that enables autonomous software agents to compete in strategic parity prediction games. The system demonstrates key software engineering principles including distributed systems architecture, protocol design, and artificial intelligence strategy implementation.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional game simulation systems often lack:
- True distributed architecture with independent components
- Standardized communication protocols enabling language-agnostic agent development
- Pluggable AI strategy frameworks for experimentation
- Real-time observability into agent decision-making

### 1.3 Solution Overview

A three-tier agent architecture where:
1. **League Manager** orchestrates tournaments and maintains standings
2. **Referee** executes individual matches between agents
3. **Player Agents** autonomously compete using configurable AI strategies
